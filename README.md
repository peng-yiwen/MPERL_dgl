# R-GCP_dgl
This repository provides the source code of **Relational-Graph Convolutional PonderNet (R-GCP)** for Entity Classification in Knowledge Graphs on FB15kET and YAGO43kET datasets. The model R-GCP is implemented using **[DGL](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl)** library.

* Baselines are available in the folder /Baseline, while R-GCN and CompGCN are adapted from this [repo](https://github.com/CCIIPLab/CET).
